        <p class="cursor">The history of anime goes back to 1907. At this time, many Japanese artists were influenced by Western animation and decided to create specific national content for Japan. This was very difficult because materials were expensive and Japan suffered several economic crises due to natural disasters and later because of WW2.</p></div>

            <div class="second">In the 1940s, Japan premiered the first animated film which was sponsored by the government. When the war ended, over the years the manga (Japanese comics) were distributed to the population. They served as a distraction from the harsh realities that Japanese people had to face after the war.</div>
            
            <div class="third">Today there are a plethora of anime titles aimed at all types of audiences, and it has grown to become one of the most important export products for the Japanese economy. Anime’s characteristics are having real-feeling plots, full of emotions and drama. In some cases, strong exaggeration of the actions performed by the characters is used. Common anime tends to have characters with large, oval eyes, outrageous haircuts, and very humanized bodies.</div>
            
                <div class="fourth">Anime should not be taken as being children’s entertainment only, it is more to the contrary. Most titles are aimed at a mature audience. There are anime companies that have managed to create content to satisfy both audiences, such as Studio Ghibli, one of the most powerful companies in the world of animation.</div>
